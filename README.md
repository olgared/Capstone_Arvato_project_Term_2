# Capstone Arvato project Term_2

The goal of this project was to analyze demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, comparing it against demographics information for the general population.


The data and outline of this project was provided by [Arvato Financial Solutions, a Bertelsmann subsidiary.](https://finance.arvato.com/en-us/)

The project has three major steps: the customer segmentation report, the supervised learning model, and the Kaggle Competition.

- Customer Segmentation Report: goal is to analyze attributes of established customers and the general population in order to create customer segments.
 - Supervised Learning ModelÂ :goal is to use the previous analysis to build a machine learning model that predicts whether or not each individual will respond to the campaign.
- Kaggle Competition: goal is to make predictions using chosen model on the campaign data as part of a Kaggle Competition.
